# Update Payment Service Integration

Updates billing service to work with new payment flow after feature flag removal.

Changes:
- Updated payment service client calls
- Removed legacy payment status handling
- Updated billing workflow logic
- Fixed integration tests

Depends on payment service feature flag removal being deployed first.
